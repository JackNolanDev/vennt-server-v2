The casting time is proportional to the MP cost to cast the spell and the complexity of the spell: this can take anywhere between minutes and days. This time can be split up among all casters who can cast both Infuse and the spell being infused. There are additional casting needs for more interesting infusions:\n\n* If the infused object only casts the spell once (e.g. upon trigger), no additional effort is needed.\n* If the infused object can cast the spell at will (e.g. an orb of scrying), the casters must spend their max MP to pay for the base MP cost of the spell. _Example: two casters are infusing a spell that usually costs 4MP to cast; they each give up 2MP from their max MP to create the magical object. Once created, a magical item can be broken down to regain those MP (see **Disenchant**)._\n* If the spell is for a summon or construct, or if the object is meant to be worn for the spell’s effect, treat this as the object being able to cast the spell at will.\n* If the infused object can cast the spell more than once but not permanently (e.g. a wand), every infusion will give the object one charge of the spell. Most simple objects are unable to hold more than one kind of spell unless there are particular components designed for this purpose. Every object has a maximum capacity of charges, often rolled in d6s. For example, wands are typically up to 4d6, mundane objects are 1d3, and rods can be up to 6d6\\. If an object is infused past its maximum capacity, it bursts open with variable effects (roll d6), such as dealing magical damage in a burst (1-2, deals 6d6 within 2 meters and 3d6 from 3-6 meters away), casting wild magic (3-5, GM's discretion), or creating an anti-magic field (6). Every time an object is given a charge, it has a small chance of breaking or weakening (less than a 5 on 3d6 it breaks, on 6 or 7 it reduces its maximum capacity by one charge).\n\n_Note: These rules are for campaign settings in which magical items are rare. GMs should feel free to adjust these rules to their campaign setting._ ","custom_fields":{"path":"Path of the Enchanter","prereq":"Disenchant","purchase":"700 XP","expedited":"Magic","activation":"Spec.","range":"Touch"},"active":false},{"name":"Healing Infusion","effect":"This spell modifies another non-healing spell you are casting which targets a single ally.
